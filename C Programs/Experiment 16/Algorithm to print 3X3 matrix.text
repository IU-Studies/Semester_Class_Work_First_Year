Algorithm to print 3X3 matrix.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `arr[3][3]`: Array to store the elements of the matrix.
- `i`, `j`: Loop control variables.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT ELEMENTS INTO THE MATRIX
- Prompt the user: "Enter elements in array:-"
- Use nested loops to read elements into `arr`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- Read an element into `arr[i][j]` using `scanf`.
5. PRINT THE MATRIX
- Use nested loops to print the elements of `arr`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- Print `arr[i][j]`.
- Print a newline after printing each row.
6. END
