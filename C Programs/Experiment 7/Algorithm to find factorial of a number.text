Algorithm to find factorial of a number.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `number`: Variable to store the input number.
- `i`: Loop control variable.
- `count = 1`: Variable to store the factorial value, initialized to 1.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT NUMBER
- Prompt the user: "Enter a number:-"
- Read the number into variable `number` using `scanf`.
5. CALCULATE FACTORIAL
- Use a loop to calculate the factorial of the input number.
- Initialize `i` to 1.
- WHILE `i` is less than or equal to `number`:
- Multiply `count` by `i` and store the result in `count`.
- Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.
6. PRINT FACTORIAL
- Print the factorial of the input number.
- Use `printf` to display: "Factorial of %d is %d", `number`, `count`.
7. WAIT FOR USER INPUT
- Use `getch()` to wait for a key press before closing the program.
8. END
