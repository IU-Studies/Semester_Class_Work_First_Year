Algorithm to find area of Rectangle.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES `length`, `breadth`, AND `area` AS FLOAT
3. CLEAR THE SCREEN
4. DISPLAY "ENTER LENGTH OF RECTANGLE:-"
5. READ THE INPUT VALUE INTO VARIABLE `length`
6. DISPLAY "ENTER BREADTH OF RECTANGLE:-"
7. READ THE INPUT VALUE INTO VARIABLE `breadth`
8. CALCULATE `area` AS `length * breadth`
9. DISPLAY "AREA IS" FOLLOWED BY `area` FORMATTED TO 2 DECIMAL PLACES
10. WAIT FOR USER INPUT TO CLOSE THE PROGRAM
11. END
