Algorithm to find area of Triangle.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES `base`, `height`, AND `area` AS FLOAT
3. CLEAR THE SCREEN
4. DISPLAY "ENTER BASE OF TRIANGLE:-"
5. READ THE INPUT VALUE INTO VARIABLE `base`
6. DISPLAY "ENTER HEIGHT OF TRIANGLE:-"
7. READ THE INPUT VALUE INTO VARIABLE `height`
8. CALCULATE `area` AS `0.5 * base * height`
9. DISPLAY "AREA IS" FOLLOWED BY `area`
10. WAIT FOR USER INPUT TO CLOSE THE PROGRAM
11. END
