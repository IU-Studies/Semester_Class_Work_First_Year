Algorithm to multiply 3X3 matrix.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `arrA[3][3]`, `arrB[3][3]`, `arrC[3][3]`: Arrays to store matrices A, B, and the resultant matrix C.
- `i`, `j`, `k`: Loop control variables.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT ELEMENTS INTO MATRIX A
- Prompt the user: "Enter elements in array A:-"
- Use nested loops to read elements into `arrA`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- Read an element into `arrA[i][j]` using `scanf`.
5. INPUT ELEMENTS INTO MATRIX B
- Prompt the user: "Enter elements in array B:-"
- Use nested loops to read elements into `arrB`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- Read an element into `arrB[i][j]` using `scanf`.
6. INITIALIZE MATRIX C TO ZERO
- Use nested loops to set all elements of `arrC` to 0.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- Set `arrC[i][j]` to 0.
7. MULTIPLY MATRICES A AND B
- Use nested loops to perform matrix multiplication and store the result in `arrC`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `k` from 0 to 2:
- Add `arrA[i][k] * arrB[k][j]` to `arrC[i][j]`.
8. PRINT THE RESULTANT MATRIX C
- Use nested loops to print the elements of `arrC`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to 2:
- FOR `j` from 0 to 2:
- Print `arrC[i][j]`.
9. END
