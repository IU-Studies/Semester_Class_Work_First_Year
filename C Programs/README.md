# This repository consists of C programs covered in the first year. 📝

- All programs are written with the **Turbo C++** compiler in mind. 
- However, if you'd like to use these programs in modern compilers like **VS Code**, 
- simply remove the `#include <conio.h>` header file (used for console input/output), 
- as well as the `clrscr()` and `getch()` functions. 🚀
- Modern compilers don’t require these! 🔧✨
