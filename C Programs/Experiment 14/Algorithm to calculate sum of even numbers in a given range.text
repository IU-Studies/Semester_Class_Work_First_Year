Algorithm to calculate sum of even numbers in a given range.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `start_range`, `end_range`: Variables to store the start and end of the range.
- `i`: Loop control variable.
- `count`: Variable to store the sum of even numbers.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT START AND END RANGE
- Prompt the user: "Enter a start range:-"
- Read the start range into variable `start_range` using `scanf`.
- Prompt the user: "Enter an end range:-"
- Read the end range into variable `end_range` using `scanf`.
5. CALCULATE THE SUM OF EVEN NUMBERS
- Initialize `count` to 0.
- Use a loop to iterate through the numbers from `start_range` to `end_range`.
- FOR `i` from `start_range` to `end_range`:
- IF `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`), add `i` to `count`.
- ELSE, continue to the next iteration.
6. PRINT THE SUM OF EVEN NUMBERS
- Print the sum of even numbers within the given range.
- Use `printf` to display: "The sum of even numbers in the given range is %d", `count`.
7. WAIT FOR USER INPUT
- Use `getch()` to wait for a key press before closing the program.
8. END
