Algorithm to find Max and Min in an array.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `arr[100]`: Array to store the elements.
- `i`, `user`: Loop control variables and the number of elements.
- `min`, `max`: Variables to store the minimum and maximum values.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT NUMBER OF ELEMENTS
- Prompt the user: "Enter number of elements:-"
- Read the number of elements into variable `user` using `scanf`.
5. INPUT ELEMENTS INTO ARRAY
- Prompt the user: "Enter elements in array:-"
- Use a loop to read elements into `arr`.
- FOR `i` from 0 to `user - 1`:
- Read an element into `arr[i]` using `scanf`.
6. FIND MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
- Initialize `min` and `max` to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`).
- Use a loop to iterate through the array and update `min` and `max` as necessary.
- FOR `i` from 0 to `user - 1`:
- IF `arr[i]` is greater than `max`, update `max` to `arr[i]`.
- IF `arr[i]` is less than `min`, update `min` to `arr[i]`.
7. PRINT MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
- Print the values of `max` and `min`.
- Use `printf` to display: "Max is %d and Min is %d".
8. WAIT FOR USER INPUT
- Use `getch()` to wait for a key press before closing the program.
9. END
