Algorithm to implement simple calculator using switch case.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `operator`: Character variable to store the operator (+, -, *, /).
- `num1`, `num2`: Integer variables to store the two numbers.
- `result`: Integer variable to store the result of the operation.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT OPERATOR
- Prompt the user: "Enter operator (+, -, *, /):-"
- Read the operator into variable `operator` using `scanf`.
5. INPUT TWO NUMBERS
- Prompt the user: "Enter two numbers:-"
- Read the two numbers into variables `num1` and `num2` using `scanf`.
6. PERFORM OPERATION BASED ON OPERATOR
- Use a switch-case statement to perform the appropriate operation based on the operator:
- CASE '+': Add `num1` and `num2` and store the result in `result`. Print the addition result.
- CASE '-': Subtract `num2` from `num1` and store the result in `result`. Print the subtraction result.
- CASE '*': Multiply `num1` and `num2` and store the result in `result`. Print the multiplication
result.
- CASE '/': If `num2` is not zero, divide `num1` by `num2` and store the result in `result`. Print the
division result. If `num2` is zero, print "Error".
- DEFAULT: Print "Error" for invalid operators.
7. WAIT FOR USER INPUT
- Use `getch()` to wait for a key press before closing the program.
8. END
