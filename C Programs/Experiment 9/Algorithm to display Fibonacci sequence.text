Algorithm to display Fibonacci sequence.

1. START
2. DECLARE VARIABLES
- `a = 0`: Variable to store the first number of the Fibonacci sequence.
- `b = 1`: Variable to store the second number of the Fibonacci sequence.
- `user`: Variable to store the length of the Fibonacci sequence.
- `c`: Variable to store the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
- `i`: Loop control variable.
3. CLEAR SCREEN
- Use `clrscr()` to clear the console screen.
4. INPUT SERIES LENGTH
- Prompt the user: "Enter series length:-"
- Read the length of the Fibonacci sequence into variable `user` using `scanf`.
5. CHECK IF SERIES LENGTH IS 1
- IF `user` is equal to 1, then:
- Print the first number `a`.
- ELSE:
- Print the first two numbers `a` and `b`.
6. GENERATE AND PRINT FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
- Use a loop to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence.
- Initialize `i` to 1.
- WHILE `i` is less than or equal to `user`:
- Calculate the next Fibonacci number `c` by adding `a` and `b`.
- Update the values of `a` and `b` for the next iteration.
- Print the Fibonacci number `c`.
- Increment `i`.
7. WAIT FOR USER INPUT
- Use `getch()` to wait for a key press before closing the program.
